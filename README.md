# SLTMVB
Sparse Generative Model For My New Paper

This paper (corresponding to this code) was submited to 《World Wide Web》 Journal.

We use the collapsed variational bayesian inference for learning the parameters. The corresponding code is SLTMVB.java.

# SLTMGibbsSampling
This code is for the other of my paper about market structures and competitive aspects learning.
We use collapsed Gibbs sampling for learning the parameters. The corresponding code is SLTMGibbsSampling.java.
